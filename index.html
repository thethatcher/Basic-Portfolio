				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>
					Ryan Thatcher was born in the Spring of 1989 to Orlan and Karen Thatcher in Salt Lake, Utah. An unremarkable baby, he wasn't able to fly or shoot laser beams out of his eyes like his older brother clark. Always in the shadow of Clark Ryan tried to find anything that he could excel at. However, anytime Clark noticed that Ryan was trying to learn something new he would super speed read books and websites on the topic and outpace Ryan's growth in the matter easily. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually Clark took on the name of "Superman" and left the family home, and his younger brother behind. Ryan didn't miss his brother, and was frankly sick of hearing how he saved this bus from certain doom, or stopped a nuclear missile from killing millions of people. superman was a realy attention hog. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Ryan picked up animation his senior year in high school, and because Clark was so busy fighting a guy who had no super powers, but was really really rich, Ryan wasn't discouraged by having someone purposefully discouraging his growth. Ryan excelled in animation and enjoyed drawing frames, designing characters, writing stories and learning the principles of design. However, there was one thing that Ryan wanted more than anything. 
				</p>
				<p>
					He wanted to be a family man, so he began picking up a profession that would allow him to spend time with his family. This might be considered an odd choice, as he wasn't dating anyone at the time, and didn't have any children. However, he is a man that plans for the future. Unfortunately for him the one time his older brother failed, it meant that the end of the world had arrived and his, as well as the Earth's, future was no more. Or at least a lot more hot, and charred than previously.
